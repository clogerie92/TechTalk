## Description

This is an application called TechTalk that is similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. TechTalk follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. It is also deployed on Heroku.
